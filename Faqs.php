                        <br>
                        ii)	Keep a very careful track of time.
                        <br>
                        iii)	Do not panic while solving your paper. Give each section a specific time period and try to complete every section on time.
                        <br>
                        iv)	If you have carefully read all the directions given in the test guide, do not waste your time by reading the directions on the answer sheet. They are exactly the same as in the guide.
                        <br>
                        v)	Do not leave any question unanswered. If you are confused or have no idea about a certain question, try making a guess for the right answer.
                        <br>
                        vi)	Do not make any extra marks on the answer sheet. Computer might register these and consider them as another marked choice.
